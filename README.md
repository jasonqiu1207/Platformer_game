Vocabulary Prince(forked from my Gatech Enterprise github repo)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of my course projects

This game is made with MelonJS, a light-weight Javascript game engine. The purpose of this game is to 
help English vocabulary learning/reinforcing. The game is mainly designed for kids. 
I also meant to practice Javascript programming in making this game.

The game is hosted on Itch.io
You can play the game here:
